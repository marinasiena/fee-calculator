An assignment to practice basic JS skills by creating a calculator.

Dan - So I do understand that eval() is an expensive process, can be dangerous since it simply runs whatever is within the parens...but in this environment with controlled input and a stand-alone app, meh?  If I couldn't use eval(), I guess I would have made strings that x10 subsequent inputs to account for placevalues, then conditions for the operators...but it would be long and messy, yeah?
